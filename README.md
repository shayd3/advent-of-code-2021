Solutions for Advent of Code 2021 - https://adventofcode.com/

# Goal
Get through all 25 days of Advent of Code all in GoLang (And actually finish...)!

Through out each challenge, the goal is try to create scalable solutions, not just code for the problem to get a single answer.

Inside of the `log.md` will contain scratch notes and retrospective entries.
